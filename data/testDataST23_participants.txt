1003769279810973696	@jsmnrn for some reason that doesn't help much maybe cuz she used to take it for so long  must have built a tolerance or something! have u tried lyrica?
1022667232701243392	@jamesyjoy Absolutely, I agree with you there.  I just think you�re preaching the wrong message here in regards to peep.  It�s not �keep doin Xanax just take the right measures to make sure it isn�t laced!� That just ain�t it bro
408631415291392000	@lindseygottvald i was on humira but it gave me lupus. i just started plaquenil and have been on celebrex for years. how do u like remicade?

524534955716923393	i dislike the way metformin makes my chest feel. like there's a tightness. #diabetes
532529673855856640	metformin has the potential to cause nausea, loose stools etc. as a potential side effect
536637524144586752	metformin is so weird cause it's the most energized i've felt in awhile but i'm also always lightheaded
494122089591623681	@americasbarbie remicade has also made me throw up before, but humira has only made me really nauseous but no vomiting

1002644660420947973	Listening to #EMRAP this month on mixing loperamide  cimetidine to get more of a “methadone” effect makes me question why opioid addicts are so much better at chemistry than me.

1015605495498002432	@bryan_leblanc @drjanaway Eastern medicine has some advantages over western medicine. An open mind to alternative 'medicine' is a good thing. We must be careful not to completely trust the Big Machine that profits off of our fear. Sure they've made many good drugs. Lipitor eg is a total scam.
1024374210611826695	@magichoney12 I take cymbalta and tramadol and lots of prescription vitamins. What can I say? The tramadol helps some.
451949417701322752	@drjanechi kind of moot now, imo, bc nobody's giving me sulfa drugs again, or taking me off celebrex or lamictal unless i get the rash back

1041887357643964421	@DrPhil That is described how I feel when I see on screen and constantly scamming for people your stupid show ratings. Also no one is gonna get over the fact you have a fmr survivor contestant take Xanax and vodka in your green room that you set in there for ratings.

446817346137518081	the only thing i hate about adderall is no appetite or sleep
1042122167213850625	Yeah it was codeine crazy.
1032797523675627526	@ugwdead I did OD on Xanax, after a long night of drinking and adderall. 55mg is A LOT. I don’t suggest it!
1021385073944383493	@StephanieKlick You would be alarmed if you knew how many high school students are already popping Xanax everyday.  Reason you aren't reading about the numbers is because it isn't killing anyone like opioids are.   Parents of teens need to get a handle on this, FAST.

1013238764682874881	@RonaldLiu3 Previously all cholesterol meds got approved based on cholesterol reduction which was surrogate marker. Lipitor later proved with CVOT benefit but Zetia and simvastatin failed. That lipid reduction is not good enough marker anymore.  ESPR has to show CVOT outcome to get approved.
